# ULK

Low profile split keyboard with Corne 42 Layout and Cerry ULP switches. Made to be used on top of a laptop keyboard to provide the ulimate split experince on the go. 

Due to the avalibaility of the ULP switches only the Click version was avaliable which is nice for home, however too lound for work at public places.

Things to do: \
   &emsp; Solder up the proper batteries.\
   &emsp; Add support for solar charging.\
   &emsp; Build a version with 35g PG1316s.\
   &emsp; Change the reset button to a lower profile SMD version.
